If a brand new technology is being experimented with, I think graphics are
extremely important to the overall experience. For example, with Avatar [^1],
despite the storyline being predictable and honestly terrible, it was wildly
successful since it introduced 3D technology to movies in a way like never
before. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and still appreciate the movie for its
technical challenges and innovations.

However, if a game/movie isn't being released for the technical challenge, I
think that too much CGI can be annoying. What I appreciate most about games is
the storyline; this to me, is more important than the graphics. However, if the
graphics are good and the story is good, I don't see anything wrong with having
lots of CGI stuff in a game or movie. For example, let's look at a game
that I've logged way too many days of playtime on (Skyrim) [^2]. The graphics
were pretty damn good, I spend a lot of time just traveling from place to place
and looking at the scenery (especially at night time, the sky is so
fantastically done). But it's the storyline that makes it for me [^3].
Otherwise, I wouldn't have spent so many hours of my life for this game. Yeah,
you know how people tend to skip past the storylines? No, not me.

On the flip side, really bad CGI can be super distracting. If it doesn't look
realistic, or at least doesn't match the aesthetic of the game/movie, CGI can
really detract from it. Unless the point is to meme or make you laugh, poorly
done CGI is painful [^4], just like seeing poorly done stunt-work. The first
thing that comes to my mind here is Game of Thrones vs. Merlin. I used to watch
Merlin years ago [^5], and while I found it semi-interesting, it drove me crazy
when I would see bad CGI, which happened a lot since they didn't have a giant
budget. Meanwhile, Game of Thrones does a pretty damn good job with CGI and
stunt work. Have you SEEN any of their behind the scenes [^6]? They might work
for days to set up one physical prop for a one-second scene. They treat CGI the
same way, it's extremely meticulous, but the end product is just amazing. They
also have a significantly bigger budget, so I get it, but still. They. Do. It.
Right.

For this week, I watched Spirited Away [^7], because my wonderful 10/10
professor said that it would count [^8]. Though the movie was mostly hand
drawn, they did start experimenting with computer animation, particularly
through the use of a program called Softimage (now discontinued, but it was
used in the early 2000s for movies, games, and advertising). However, Hayao
Miyazaki (the director, but you already know that) was very careful about
keeping a hand drawn feel and not letting fancy animations steal the show.
While, as I said above, I usually don't mind lots of CGI as long as the plot is
great, it makes sense that Spirited Away didn't use too much of it since it
didn't match the aesthetics of the film.

Overall, don't do CGI if you can't do it well. If you can, then go crazy, and I
don't mind. But good CGI doesn't make a bad movie/game good, it just makes it
not terrible. Most importantly, MAKE A GOOD STORYLINE. That's the kicker. If
you have that, then most other transgressions can be forgiven.
