The general public associates gamers with dark rooms, teenage boys that haven't
taken showers in days [^1], snacks all around them, etc. And while there are
many gamers [^2] that fall under that category, not all gamers are like that
[^3].  Similarly, not all games in general are of the type that you can play in
a dark room.

Anyone who knew me as a kid (and anyone who regularly attends History of
Computing) knows that I used to play a lot of Stepmania as a kid, so my
viewpoint on interactive games is probably pretty obvious. Nevertheless, I
guess I'll talk about it for the points [^4]. Also, I don't think you need
screenshot proof that I played Stepmania for this week. You've seen me play
Stepmania, you know this is a thing. Cool. Here's me forcing my friendly local
nieghborhood troll to play Boys (on medium, ezpz can I just say)

As a kid, I had a lot of energy. I wish I still had that energy, but we can't
have it all, can we? Regardless, games like Stepmania were an obvious way for
me to expend some of that energy without driving my parents insane [^5].
Interactive gaming adds a new level of excitement to gaming. Though games that
don't use special periphreals aren't any less interesting, adding a periphreal
to a game can make for a great experience if it's done well/tastefully. Half
the fun of Stepmania is doing things on feet, actually getting up and moving
[^6].  The premise of the game on its own is quite simple, the dance pad is the
star of the show.

Another good example I enjoyed growing up was Donkey Kong Jungle Beat. [^7] It
came with fancy congo drums, and you had to beat the drums and clap to make DK
move/jump around. The congos took a fun, but simple game, and made it
memorable. The point - periphreals are just one of many ways to make games
exciting. They don't innately make a game superior or inferior.

I can't say that I definitely prefer "interactive" or "passive" games. Above
were two examples of games that were made better by periphreals, but there are
many other games I've enjoyed that required a more passive playstyle, and in
fact, I've played many more passive games than interactive [^8]. I have fun
with both, and which I prefer depends on my mood. In general, passive games,
since they don't have the excitement of periphreals, tend to have more of a
storyline, so if I'm looking for that, I'll play a more passive game [^9].

I'm also a fan of VR, to an extent. Though it can make you dizzy, I've had a
lot of fun playing games like Fruit Ninja and Skyrim with a VR headset [^10]. I
definitely think it has a future, though I wouldn't argue that it will replace
regular gaming.

Overall, I'm a fan of both passive and interactive gaming [^11]. They have
their ups and downs, and sometimes I really prefer one or the other, but good
games exist in both categories; the presense of periphreals won't make a bad
game good, and their absence is sometimes a good thing.

[^1]: which by the way, I've seen too much of and is gross.
[^2]: programmers in general too, now that I mention it.
[^3]: #notallgamers2k18. spread the word.
[^4]: and on the off chance that anyone cares. but i doubt anyone cares
[^5]: execpt I was totally a good kid growing up. obviously.
[^6]: not to say that hands aren't fun either!
[^7]: oh, so much of my life...I think I logged the most playtime on my
GameCube when I was real smol
[^8]: diablo, final fantasy, portal, elder scrolls games, oni, all derivations
of mario games, zelda, assassin's creed, the sabatoeur, darksiders, prince of
persia, to name the few off the top of my head that I really enjoyed in no
particular order
[^9]: though this isn't always the case, especially when we talk about VR! see:
skyrim VR
[^10]: slicing actual FRUIT with an actual (virtual) katana is dope. plz don't
try and tell me otherwise.
