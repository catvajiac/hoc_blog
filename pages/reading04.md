Don't hate me because these are late. I just knew you were waiting with baited
breath for them, but you'll just have to deal with it for now.

I think I've mentioned this before, but growing up for me, I was more of a PC
gamer than a console gamer, since all consoles I've owned excepting the Wii
I got on the good graces of other people, particularly my uncle [^1]. But I did end
up playing quite a few. If I had to pick a favorite, it would probably be the
N64, partially for nostalgia, but partially because it was really fun.

I used to play on the N64 on a tiny TV in my best friend's RV, in the bed above
the driver's seat [^2]. We all were aggressively competitive while playing
Super Smash Bros, and some of my fondest memories come from that time. I also
played a lot of Ocarina of Time in those days. But apart from the nostalgia, I
liked the controller alot. In fact, my favorite controllers have been Nintendo
ones (I really enjoyed the SNES controller as well). I have some pictures of us
playing on Gameboys back then, which are super relevant...

And this one too...

Wow, we used to be little. I miss those days...

What I really liked about Nintendo consoles in general growing up was the
games. I felt like they were really approachable; most of my closest friends
weren't as into gaming as I was, but they were willing to play something like
Super Mario Bros 3, or Smash Bros. When the GameCube came out, I got them to
play Kirby Airride, Simpsons Hit and Run, and Tony Hawk games with me (all on
GameCube). Most of the Nintendo games I owned were approachable enough that
they were willing to play at least for a little while.

I never considered a console's hardware specs growing up, so I wouldn't
consider that a big factor of importance when it comes to choosing a superior
console. Firstly, I wouldn't have really understood what they meant, I knew
nothing about hardware as a child [^3]. But secondly, I don't think I would
have cared all that much as long as the games offered on any given console were
playable and enjoyable.

[^1]: which was a big deal...my parents NEVER bought consoles/games.
[^2]: we were so small, they fit four of us and a TV and an N64 up there.
[^3]: until my brother opened up a computer tower with me and explained very
generally what the different parts did. that was the first time I ever thought
about a future in computing.
