<p>When I was little, I really enjoyed playing games of all kinds, especially with my friends. Locally, there are a handful of Romanian families that have banded together, who all have children of similar age. Our Romanian “group” first got together when I was pretty young, maybe eight or so, and those children have become my closest friends - most of us feel like cousins or siblings. Whenever we would have a get-together, we would usually spend the first few hours just chatting or playing, but as the night wound down, we always eventually moved to playing a board game or card game <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I also played video games, but I found it harder to connect to some people with them. My best friend hated video games, but I would often wake up early at sleepovers and play with her little brother <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. My favorites growing up were Super Mario All-Stars for Super Nintendo, a random Bungie game called Oni that nobody’s ever heard of, and of course, Diablo II, which I started playing when I was 6 or so <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I played games for many reasons. For board/card games, I played them as a way to have fun and interact with my friends. We were able to learn a lot about each other and have something to laugh or yell about. I still love playing cards with new people I meet because you get to learn a lot about them that way. With video games, it was different. I played them for the same reason that I would pick up a book; my favorites had a story, an interesting universe in which the characters were placed, and kept me motivated to learn. Games like Portal and any Elder Scrolls game are some of my favorite games becuase their worlds captivated me. My favorite games were also quite challenging; I loved having an interesting puzzle/problem to think through.</p>
<p>I think many people play games for similar reasons that I did; they help you connect with people, stretch the limits of your imagination, and challenge you. For me, these are really important aspects of games in general. I liked having a game where I could devise a strategy, where some logic was involved, both for video and non-video games. This is essential for a good video game. While games must be stochastic in some sense, if the entire game is dependent on chance then I wouldn’t get any more enjoyment out of playing that game as I would playing a slot machine.</p>
<p>Board games are similar to video games in that you can form a connection with people. Though I did find it harder in some cases, it also allowed me to get close to certain people. The puzzle/strategy aspect of gaming is also the same in both video games and board games. However, when it comes to the artistic and creative aspects of a game, board games are left behind in the dust. While really well-designed board games exist and can be exciting, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a board game with the artistic quality and creativity even close to what’s found in Skyrim. Video games allow you to create an immersive and interactive world that is simply impossible with the static pieces of a board game. This is where I would say that video games are superior, but for me, it also makes the dangerous. Once I start a game, I find it very difficult to stop playing in every spare moment I have. In fact, the summer after my freshman year of college, all I did was sit in my room and play Skyrim while eating junk food <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. For that reason, I’ve kind of taken the backseat where it comes to gaming in the past few years, but that’s a different story.</p>
