<p>Many people (me included) consider the first “real” video game to be tennis for two. The goal of tennis for two was simple; this one dude named William Higinbotham just wanted something amusing for the annual visitor’s day at Brookhaven National Lab. Did he intend to kickstart a revolution, to start the game industry? Nah. When he realized what he’d done, he probably felt like he created something a little like this… <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Sometimes, unintended consequences make for the best stories. This is one of those times.</p>
<p>At a time when computer science was young, some nerds <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> decided to make Spacewar! on a PDP-1. Ah, the good old days, when you’d do 36-hour sprints, inhaling all the caffiene and chinese food in sight <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. This game was revolutionary; we have many players here, including real-time action, shooting your friends, and hyperspace. Don’t threaten me with a good time. Spacewar! was so amazing, people still play it today, I’m sure of it…maybe even in History of Computing classes, could you imagine? Something else amazing Spacewar! did was getting you to feel frustration like you never felt before <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Spacewar! might have been more popular in the 1960’s and 1970’s if there was a way for most people to play it. Unfortunately, it was mostly engineering students that got to give it a go. Believe it or not, there was a time where in-home game consoles and PCs weren’t commonplace <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>If people didn’t have ways to play games at home, what did they do <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>? Soon enough, video games in arcades started to properly surface. After some failures and a lot of people sitting around, not sure what they were doing exactly <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>, eventually Pong was born and placed in the back of a bar (Andy Capp’s). A few days later, the machine “broke” because there were too many coins in the coin box. People were flocking to the bar, but not to drink, to play! Finally, games were available to the mainstream, and the mainstream loved it.</p>
<p>These original games, of course, lacked many of the features modern games have today, but in my experience, it doesn’t make them less fun to play. While playing a VR game is new and exciting, or playing through an intricate storyline like the Portal series can make you feel all the feels, there’s an element of simplicity that I love about older games. First, they’re more approachable to the average person - I could get my best friend (who doesn’t really like games that much) to play Pong, but she wouldn’t touch something as immersive, complex, and full-featured as Skyrim <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Home consoles also became a thing, though quite different from the consoles we use today. The Mangavox Oddesy had no sound, hardly any graphics, and very limited features…but all revolutions have to start somewhere, right? Even so, something I think is impressive was accomplished; having a light gun peripheral. I’m a big fan of peripherals myself <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, as primitive as these games may seem to the average muh-lenny-uhl, they were the foundation on which everything else could be built upon. Even if you think they’re lame <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, at least appreciate that, without them, you couldn’t play any games. Even if you only play cute lil apps on your phone. Thanks Pong, Spacewar!, and real O.G. peeps like tennis for two, for creating a world that I think is not only immersive and super fun, but also, is a beautiful form of art <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>. :)</p>

<p>When I was little, I really enjoyed playing games of all kinds, especially with my friends. Locally, there are a handful of Romanian families that have banded together, who all have children of similar age. Our Romanian “group” first got together when I was pretty young, maybe eight or so, and those children have become my closest friends - most of us feel like cousins or siblings. Whenever we would have a get-together, we would usually spend the first few hours just chatting or playing, but as the night wound down, we always eventually moved to playing a board game or card game <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I also played video games, but I found it harder to connect to some people with them. My best friend hated video games, but I would often wake up early at sleepovers and play with her little brother <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. My favorites growing up were Super Mario All-Stars for Super Nintendo, a random Bungie game called Oni that nobody’s ever heard of, and of course, Diablo II, which I started playing when I was 6 or so <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I played games for many reasons. For board/card games, I played them as a way to have fun and interact with my friends. We were able to learn a lot about each other and have something to laugh or yell about. I still love playing cards with new people I meet because you get to learn a lot about them that way. With video games, it was different. I played them for the same reason that I would pick up a book; my favorites had a story, an interesting universe in which the characters were placed, and kept me motivated to learn. Games like Portal and any Elder Scrolls game are some of my favorite games becuase their worlds captivated me. My favorite games were also quite challenging; I loved having an interesting puzzle/problem to think through.</p>
<p>I think many people play games for similar reasons that I did; they help you connect with people, stretch the limits of your imagination, and challenge you. For me, these are really important aspects of games in general. I liked having a game where I could devise a strategy, where some logic was involved, both for video and non-video games. This is essential for a good video game. While games must be stochastic in some sense, if the entire game is dependent on chance then I wouldn’t get any more enjoyment out of playing that game as I would playing a slot machine.</p>
<p>Board games are similar to video games in that you can form a connection with people. Though I did find it harder in some cases, it also allowed me to get close to certain people. The puzzle/strategy aspect of gaming is also the same in both video games and board games. However, when it comes to the artistic and creative aspects of a game, board games are left behind in the dust. While really well-designed board games exist and can be exciting, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a board game with the artistic quality and creativity even close to what’s found in Skyrim. Video games allow you to create an immersive and interactive world that is simply impossible with the static pieces of a board game. This is where I would say that video games are superior, but for me, it also makes the dangerous. Once I start a game, I find it very difficult to stop playing in every spare moment I have. In fact, the summer after my freshman year of college, all I did was sit in my room and play Skyrim while eating junk food <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. For that reason, I’ve kind of taken the backseat where it comes to gaming in the past few years, but that’s a different story.</p>
