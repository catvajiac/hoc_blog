Source for my History of Computing (read, gaming) blog, hosted
[here](https://catvajiac.github.io/hoc_blog/). Definitely the most serious,
non-derpy blog out there. Feel free to read into my personal experiences with
gaming both through childhood and though this class, or don't...either way is
fine by me. :]
